        <h4>MEET AMIRA</h4>
        Hi! My name is Amira Bagley and I love music. I began playing violin at the age of three and started teaching in 2015. I graduated from Brigham Young University-Idaho in April 2018 with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Music. While at BYU-Idaho I had the opportunity to study violin with Dr. Dallin Hansen and Dr. Rebecca Roesler. I also played in the BYU-Idaho Symphony Orchestra under the direction of Dr. Robert Tueller. In July 2017 I took the Every Child Can and Suzuki Violin Unit 1 teacher training courses with Charles Krigbaum, and took Unit 2 in 2019 from Mark Mutter. In 2021 I took Unit 3 from James Hutchins and Unit 4 from Ed Kreitman. I have also played in the Cache Symphony Orchestra under Dr. Mark Emile.
        I currently live in Rigby, Idaho with my husband Eric and our two daughters. I teach private violin lessons and enjoy playing soccer, reading, and spending time outdoors with my family.


        <h4>SUZUKI APPROACH</h4>
        “Teaching music is not my main purpose. I want to make good citizens. If children hear fine music from the day of their birth and learn to play it, they develop sensitivity, discipline and endurance. They get a beautiful heart.” 
        ― Shinichi Suzuki

      <h3>Studio Policies</h3>
      <p>
        Bagley Music Studio Policies

        Parent and Student Responsibilities
        
        During Lessons
        
        For students twelve years and under, I expect a parent to be present and attentive at all lessons. Please be prepared to take notes so you know what to practice with your child during the week. When possible, the parent that practices with the child should be the one attending the lessons with them. Parents of children over twelve are welcome but not required to attend.
        
        
        Please set all electronic devices to silent and put them away during lessons and recitals with the exception of using phones to create practice videos as directed or to record a performance.
        
        Please arrive early enough that the student can use the restroom, wash their hands, clip their nails if needed, and prepare their instrument before the lesson. Bring all materials to every lesson: music, lesson binder, instrument, and technology to record practice videos.
        
        Between Lessons
        
        For students under age twelve, it is the parent's responsibility to practice with the child each day and start the Suzuki CD for listening. Gradually, as the student is capable, they will take over these responsibilities.  Usually, by age thirteen, they will be practicing on their own. If a student wants to progress, five to six focused practice sessions per week is essential. I encourage parents and older students to read Nurtured By Love, Beyond the Music Lesson, and use the Positive Practice workbook to facilitate positive, productive practice sessions.
        
        
        Students need to have a teacher-approved instrument. The violin is an extremely challenging instrument to learn and every effort made should be rewarded by a beautiful sound. In addition, the violin needs to be kept in good working condition. Change strings regularly (about once a year or as needed).
        
        Please keep the student's nails trimmed so they do not interfere with violin playing.
        
        Participation in local orchestra programs, when available, is encouraged.
        
        Other Studio Policies and Information
        
        Absences and sickness
        
        If you or your child are sick, please do not come to the lesson, but let me know as soon as possible if you must miss a lesson. Zoom lessons can be arranged if you are unable to attend in person but would still like to have a lesson. I require 24 hours' notice to reschedule a lesson and appreciate a week's notice.  I only teach for the first two weeks in December and charge half tuition for that month. Summer (June-August) lessons are available but optional and can be paid for per lesson instead of monthly if preferred.
        
        Recitals
        
        Recitals are held twice per school year, typically in May and November. Please put the dates in your calendar as soon as you receive them and make recital attendance a priority.
        
        Siblings
        
        Siblings are welcome to attend lessons as long as they aren't a distraction. Bring books or other quiet activities for them to entertain themselves.
        
        Termination of Lessons
        
        I save spots in my studio for hard workers and take my commitment to each student seriously. I reserve the right to stop lessons with a child because of a bad attitude in parent or child, lack of effort, too many missed lessons, or my own needs. The student/parent may also cancel lessons at any time for any reason.
        
        Tuition Prices
        
        Thirty-minute lessons: $75/month
        
                    Additional children: $65/month
        
        Forty-five-minute lessons: $100/month*
        
        Hour lessons: $125/month
        
        *Forty-five-minute lessons are recommended for students in Suzuki volume 2 or higher and often earlier for older students.
        
        Tuition is due at the first lesson of the month. I accept PayPal, Venmo, cash, or check. Repertoire and other materials are purchased separately.
        
        Thank you for this opportunity to create beautiful music together!

        Gear

        Here are a few things to help you play:
        Metronome/tuners
        
        I use the KORG TM-40. It doesn't really matter what one you get, but I do think it is nice to have a physical metronome and tuner.
        
        Phone apps: I use Soundcorset tuner & metronome. It's free and does the job.
        
        
        Shoulder Rests
        
        My go-to shoulder rest brand is Kun. Make sure you get the type that can adjust to fit two sizes instead of just one.
        
        
        Strings
        
        I use Dominant strings. I also like Pirastro Gold and Lenzner for the E strings. Make sure you pay attention to whether you need ball or loop ends before purchasing.
        
        All ball-end strings:
        
        Ball-end G, D, and A strings with Loop-end E:
        
        Here is a video demo on how to change a string:
        
        https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ogTLNZwtbms 
        
        
        Make sure your strings are in good working condition. Ideally, you should change strings at least once a year, but definitely as soon as they start to unravel, go false, or snap.
        
        
        Music Stand
        
        Get one. You will use it for the rest of your life. There are some decent folding ones for under $15.
