        Tag
            HTML tags are key words surrounded by angle brackets: ie 
            <body>
        Element
            An HTML element usually consists of a start tag and end tag, with the content inserted in between:
            <p>Content</p>
        Nesting
            Elements placed inside of other elements are called nested. Nested Elements are indented to make it easier to see which elements are inside of others.
            <div>
                <p>Content</p>
            </div>
        Parent
            In nesting the parent is the element that contains other elements.
            Child
            In nesting a child element is contained  inside of another element
            <div>  <-- Parent  
                <p>Content</p> <-- Child
            </div>
        Attribute
            Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are placed inside of the opening tag. The value of the attribute should be wrapped in quotes. ie
            <p title="A paragraph about where I am from" >Idaho</p>
        Semantics
            Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language. Semantic elements = elements with a meaning. Writing semantic HTML means using the html tag that best describes the content you are adding to your page.
